I am a computer scientist and roboticist currently working at [Motional](https://motional.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer in the Motion Planning team.
I am a recent PhD graduate in Computing in the Robotics track from the [Kahlert School of Computing (KSoC)](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) and [Robotics Center](https://robotics.coe.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).
My research was focused in robot motion planning, continuum robot force modeling, and numerical reproducibility.
I performend research as a member of

- [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Medicine Lab (ARMLab)](https://arm.cs.utah.edu/) under [Prof. Alan Kuntz](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~adk/).
- [Center for Parallel Computing (CPU)](http://www.parallel.utah.edu/) under [Prof. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/) in collaboration with [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL)](https://www.llnl.gov/).
