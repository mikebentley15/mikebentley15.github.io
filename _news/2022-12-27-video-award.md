title: Won the grand prize for the 2022 IEEE Access Best Video Award Part 1
---

For the IEEE Access paper, "Interactive-Rate Supervisory Control for Arbtirarily-Routed Multitendon Robots via Motion Planning," I submitted a short video abstract concisely describing the work and contributions.  This video won the grand prize for the [2022 IEEE Access Best Video Award Part 1](https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/about-ieee-access/announcements/bestvideoaward_winnerovertime/)!

Here is the video if you'd like to see it :smiley::
